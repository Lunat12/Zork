# Zork
Conversational game based on the game Zork.

The objective of this game is to get all the quest points by the end of the game. How to get the perfect score is hidden until completion and won't show up if the player ends up dead, but it should be easy to get by completing the main objective: getting a unicorn.

The game allows for some extra features like having NPCs follow you around, speaking to them, and using their inventory and skills.
